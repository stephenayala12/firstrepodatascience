#The importance of the projects study is it can peak interest in non majors and students who are contemplating the switch of moving to a technolopgy related major whether that be computer scence or information technology. These surveys can be used to show the benefit and how many students are switching to technology majors from these yearly surveys


From this study i concluded the following

i removed these pieces of data because the Gender and the race/ethnicity dont matter when it comes to considering the factor for why people are coming to ccm. I did leave age because i personally believe the age does play a part because people could be looking at career changes so they decided to pursue ccm to start that.

The computing courses factor also didnt need any information regarding a persons race or gender but i left the important questions like if they recieved information about anything about computing courses before or if it was there first choice and capitalized on those data questions because those highly contribute to why a student might choose CCM.
